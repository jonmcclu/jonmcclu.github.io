# About the Projects


These projects will be, for the most part, mirrors of repositories hosted on my self-hosted install of Gitlab. You are welcome to register for an account [here](https://gitlab.developernexus.app), or simple explore the public-facing repositories by going [here](https://gitlab.developernexus.app/explore).

Why go through the trouble of mirroring a repository to GitHub, instead of just hosting it directly on GitHub? One of the major drawbacks of GitHub is the inability to adequately organize the repositories; it is, however, one of the largest services for hosting Git repositories and, as such, people are more likely to find GitHub repositories to review the code or give feedback. On the other hand, Gitlab provides people with the ability to create 'groups' and 'subgroups' for their projects, which allows people to organize their projects in a fairly simple, easy-to-understand manner.

The majority of work will be done directly on my [self-hosted Gitlab](https://gitlab.developernexus.app). Planned tasks, submitted issues, the general upkeep of the repository will be handled there, while the GitHub mirror will serve as the 'front-end'.

# General Guideline for Repository Styling Convention


Each repository will contain a README.md file that have 'About', 'Purpose', 'Installation Instructions', and 'Usage Instructions'. The repository will, also, have a license file to indicate its sharability and a .gitignore file to prevent common local configurations from being added to the repositories. When necessary, the README.md file will have a final section for crediting contributers for their work on the project.

Filenames & directory names will be formatted as follows:
* Always lowercase.
* Replace spaces with underscores (i.e. check_platform.py)

*Note:  the repositories and projects will be using either a parent/child or primary/secondary naming convention when required. Blocklist and allowlist will also be used. Please let me know*
